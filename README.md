# javascript-for-diehard-java-devs

If you are a full-stack engineer like me, you may have purposefully avoided any form of JavaScript development for over a decade. 

The logic behind the avoidance is that it's hard enough to master and keep up with Java, and if you're a client-side consultant, you have to put up 
with all kinds of client-side matters to boot (including stack changes with each project). Moreover, with top-notch frameworks such as 
[Vaadin](http://www.vaadin.com) as the front-end arrow in your quiver, it becomes hard to devote one's free time to Javascript and the 
potential for browser incompatibility burn. Even worse, if you are a full-stack developer, this implies mastering say bash, cloud computing 
and much more.

Well, times have changed in recent years, and some of the key developments that have convinced me that it's ill-advised to keep dodging JavaScript 
include:

* [Reactive Design Patterns](https://www.manning.com/books/reactive-design-patterns) and the accompanying [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org).
* The Model-View-ViewModel Architectural Pattern (MVVM) and supporting frameworks (e.g. [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org)).
* [Service Oriented Front End Architecture](http://www.smart-soft.com/downloads/articles/sofea.html) (SOFEA).

So, on with mastering JavaScript, even as a diehard Java developer.
